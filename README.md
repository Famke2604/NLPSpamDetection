# NLPSpamDetection

For this project of NLP (Maastricht University, FSE, DKE) we created a spam filter that used Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to classify an email from the Enron-Spam dataset. The data can be found from this link: http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/

Before creating and training the classifiers, we preprocessed the data. We removed punctuation, removed stopwords and tokenization. 




Results Naive Bayes:

Accuracy = 97.47%
